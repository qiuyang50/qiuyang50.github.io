&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an atmospheric dynamics scientist with a keen interest in studying large-scale organized convection such as the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Compared with individual thunderstorms that only persist for a few hours, organized convection such as MCSs can last for more than a day and releases a massive amount of rainfall, inducing a vast impact on local weather and the hydrologic cycle. However, it is a huge challenge for global climate models (GCMs) to accurately simulate organized convection and the associated precipitation. My major expertise lies in **developing theoretical models for organized convection**, in combination with observations, numerical models, and applied math tools. The goal of my research is to obtain a better understanding of the **fundamental mechanisms** of organized convection and provide useful guidelines for improving weather and climate models.
