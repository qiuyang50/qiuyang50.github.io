&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an atmospheric dynamics scientist with a keen interest in studying large-scale organized convection such as the [Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsWHHE_jkGE&t=137s) and [mesoscale convective systems (MCSs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoscale_convective_system). Compared with individual thunderstorms that only persist for a few hours, organized convection such as MCSs can last for more than a day and releases a massive amount of rainfall, inducing a vast impact on local weather and the hydrologic cycle. However, it is a huge challenge for global climate models (GCMs) to accurately simulate organized convection and the associated precipitation. My major expertise lies in **developing theoretical models for organized convection**, in combination with observations, numerical models, and applied math tools. The goal of my research is to obtain a better understanding of the **fundamental mechanisms** of organized convection and provide useful guidelines for improving weather and climate models. Below I will briefly describe a few major research projects I have done.  

### Topic 1: Multi-scale organization of tropical convection in the MJO

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One striking feature of the MJO is its high complexity in the multi-scale organized structure (right figure is from Nazakawa 1988), that is, the planetary-scale envelope of the MJO typically contains several synoptic-scale convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs), the latter of which further contain numerous embedded MCSs that consists of even smaller-scale cumulus convection. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-scale interactions of tropical convection in the MJO sheds lights on many fundamental mechanisms for the observation. How to understand the barrier effect of the Maritime continent for the passage of the MJO? By developing systematically a theoretical framework, we showed that this barrier effect is related to the multi-time scale interactions between the diurnal cycle and the MJO over the Maritime Continent.
