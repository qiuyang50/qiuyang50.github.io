## Atmospheric Sciences
Prof. David Randall from Colorado State University wrote a series of [QuickStudies](http://hogback.atmos.colostate.edu/group/dave/QuickStudies.html) essays to provide brief, readable, and accessible summaries of selected background topics in Atmospheric Sciences. 

Prof. Kerry Emanuel from Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote a [commentary](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019AV000129), highlighting the importance of "theory" and advocating that "we must resist the wholesale migration of atmospheric, oceanic, and climate science away from a traditional curiosity‐driven scientific endeavor to the more strictly applied
venture of predicting weather and climate."

## Academic Job Hunt
Prof. A.W. Peet from University of Toronto wrote a [document](https://kiwi.to/stuff/pep-to/career2002.pdf) in 2002 about how to find a job in the academy. Many of his advice, I believe, still applies for today's academic job market.
