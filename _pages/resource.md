## Reanalysis data
[**ERA5**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview) is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. 

## Models
[**The System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM)**](http://rossby.msrc.sunysb.edu/~marat/SAM.html) is a very cute cloud-resolving model. It's useful for conducting idealized cloud-resolving simulaltions for a theoretical purpose.
